    <h2>Bio: Creative non-fiction / fiction writer
    <h2>Artist Statement:</h2>
    This was the first time makiong digital work. 
    I enjoyed using colours as aesthetics and would like to further investigate this mode of work.
    Digital writing offers new ideas and outcomes to create works of both text and images. 
    I made a simple twine story, based on symbolism and learning the power of self. 
    <h2>Something about myself:</h2>
    Having completed an Advance Dipolma in Screenwriting and now 3rd year BA in Creative Writing, 
    I am now focusing on my debut novel titled: Ain't your Business, with the hopes of turning it into a TV series. 
    Ain't your Business is based on a diverse collective of people, in a yet to be decriminalized work force, set in Melbourne.
