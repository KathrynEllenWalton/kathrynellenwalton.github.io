      <h2>Bio:</h2>
      Creative Non-Ficton // Ficton Writer
      Having completed an Advanced Diploma in Screenwriting and now 3rd year BA in Creative Writing,  
      I am now focusing on my debut novel titled: 'Ain't your Business' -  with the hopes of turning it into a TV series.  
      'Ain't your Business' is based on a diverse collective of people,
      in a yet to be decriminalized work force, set in Melbourne. 
      
     <h2>Artist Statement:</h2>
     Digital Writing is a new concept to me, which I thoroughly enjoyed, 
     yet still trying to understand coding. I enjoyed using colours as aesthetics 
     and would like to further investigate this mode of work. 
    What i like about digital writing is taht it offers new ideas and outcomes to create 
    works of both text and images.I made a simple twine story, 
    based on symbolism and learning the power of self.
