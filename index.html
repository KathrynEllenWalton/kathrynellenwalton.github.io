      <h2>Bio:</h2>
      <h3> Creative Non-Ficton // Ficton Writer
        
        Having completed an Advanced Diploma in Screenwriting and now 3rd year BA in Creative Writing,  
        I am now focusing on my debut novel titled: 'Ain't your Business' - 
        with the hopes of turning it into a TV series.  
        'Ain't your Business' is based on a diverse collective of people,
        in a yet to be decriminalized work force, set in Melbourne, where I am currently based. 
       </h3> 

     <h2>Artist Statement:</h2>
     <h3>Digital Writing is a new concept to me, which I thoroughly enjoyed, 
      yet still trying to understand coding. I enjoyed using colours as aesthetics 
      and would like to further investigate this mode of work. 
      What I like about digital writing is that it offers new ideas and outcomes to create 
      works of both text and images. I made a simple twine story, 
      based on symbolism and learning the power of self.
      I have always been interested in psychology as a subtextual theme in my work and 
      try to layer both the protagonist and the antagonist within it. 
      Therefore, in my writing, I aim to capture the emotional intelligence level(s) and 
      spiritual abilities of characters, as it is what makes my stories move forward. </h3>
